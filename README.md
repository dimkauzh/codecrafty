### Setting up

Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dimkauzh/codecrafty.git
cd codecrafty
```

Then run the setup command:
```bash
make setup
```

### Build/Run

To run codecrafty, simply run the following command:
```bash
make run
```

To build codecrafty to a executable, run the following command:
```bash
